ERD Description

Users can create multiple Posts, leave multiple Comments, and have multiple Tokens.

Posts belong to a User, can have multiple Comments, and can be associated with multiple Tags through the PostTag join table.

Comments belong to both a User and a Post.

Tags can be associated with multiple Posts through the PostTag table.

Tokens are linked to Users for functionalities like activation and reset.

Using a tool like dbdiagram.io, Lucidchart, or any ERD generator, you can visually represent the above entities and their relationships.
